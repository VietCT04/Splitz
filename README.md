A simple expense book where you create a group, log expenses, and the app automatically divides the total amount equally among all active members.

What i have learnt through this project:

- Configure JWT stateless.
- Design relational DB schemas with clear ownership and normalized tables.
- Design low latancy RESTful APIs (CSR model)
- Optimize SQL queries 
- Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend and DB to Render by dockerized the Spring Boot + Postgres (but this has cold start - trying to deploy on VM)
